# Status - September 2022

Pax is now available in _alpha preview._  It is not yet fully useful or functional, but will now be developed in the open, in hopes that others may find Pax interesting and choose to help push it forward.  

[Read this section](./intro-authors-and-contributors.md#how-to-contribute-to-pax) for some ideas on how to help.

#### Run demo
As of this writing, you can run the Pax demo for macOS and Web on the `jabberwocky-demo` branch, after following the instructions in README.md, then using the shell scripts `./run.sh` and `./run-web.sh`

<!-- TODO: embed demo video -->

This has only been tested on macOS!  The Web example should work, perhaps out-of-the-box, on Linux and Windows development machines.  The macOS example will only compile if you are developing on a Mac.

#### Compiler finish-line
The most fundamental remaining work for Pax to become useful is to finish _automation of the compiler_.  Until that automation is complete, here are the manual steps necessary to write a Pax program today:
 - "unroll" any Pax code into RIL ("Rust Intermediate Language"), in the specific format required by `pax-cartridge`.  This includes creating individual vtable entries for each expression and writing instance factories for each component.
 - compile the resulting Rust "cartridge" into a library
 - load that cartridge library into one or more native app chassis (e.g. pax-chassis-macos) and build the chassis/cartridge combo into a single `cdylib`, then
 - plug that `cdylib` into the appropriate platform "harness", running an external compiler to generate a final executable (.app, .exe, etc.)
 
This is not particularly user-friendly: what would be the point of writing C if you had to manually unroll it into assembly before you could run a program?

The work for the compiler finish-line is happening on the `master` branch on GitHub.  Once this work is done — and you can write + automatically compile basic Pax programs — Pax can progress from `alpha preview` to `alpha`.

Hot on the heels of compiler finish-line work will be _error message_ improvements and a _language server_ for debugging & syntax highlighting, among [other things](https://www.github.com/pax-lang/pax/blob/master/TODO.md).

#### Async
A common use-case with GUIs is: "load some data from server; update GUI."

While awaiting a response from the server, a user may reasonably expect that the GUI will continue rendering, animating, or updating.

This is not yet the case for Pax, because it does not yet attach to async Rust code.

The planned approach is to write all future [event handlers](./start-key-concepts-event-handlers.md) as `async`, and to dispatch those methods asynchronously via the Pax runtime.

```rust
#[pax(/*...*/)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    pub app_data: Property<String>
}
impl MyStruct {
    //Note the `async` below!
    #[pax_on(DidMount)]
    pub async fn fetch_data(mut self) {
        //Proposed API:  for async functions, a "disposable" copy of the struct is passed by move from the Pax runtime. `my_crate::MyStruct::fetch_data(disposable_copy)`
        //`Property` is in charge of opaquely managing message-passing, such that by calling
        //`self.app_data.set("new value".to_string())` on this local, disposable `self`, a message is
        //sent to the canonical PropertyInstance to update its value.
    }
}
```

The above approach will require embedding an async runtime into the engine. In the long run, this will require that the async runtime can be parameterized, or swapped out.  One possible approach is via the `patch` mechanism used already inside `pax build`.

#### Cross-platform++
Further work remains to run Pax on more screens.  To support a new platform (like Android,) a new `chassis` and `dev harness` must be built.  Thus far, two `(chassis, dev harness)` pairs have been built:  see `pax-chassis-macos/` and `pax-chassis-web/`.

In order to support targeting Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS, a `chassis` and `dev harness` will need to be written for each platform.  In broad strokes:
 1. writing a low-level bridge in a platform-native language (e.g. Swift on macOS) to accept the C structs that pass over the wire from the Pax engine, and
 2. interpreting these structs as messages, mapping into CRUD operations for native elements like text and form controls. (search for the method `processNativeMessageQueue` in `pax-chassis-macos` for an example.)  `pax-chassis-ios` will be able to share about 90% of the logic already written for `pax-chassis-macos`, so iOS support is close at hand.
 3. keeping each chassis' CRUD logic updated over time with the addition of further native rendering elements, like form controls and drawing primitives

#### More primitives, form controls, and layout components
Pax's component library is just getting started, and to be a truly useful GUI and graphics toolkit it requires a more thorough standard library.

Some high-priority upcoming pieces:

**Form controls:**
 - Dropdown list
 - Text input box
 - Checkbox
 - Radio button list
 - File upload
 - Date picker
 
**Drawing primitives**
 - Path (bezier sequence)
 - Ellipse
 - Polygon

**Layouts & widgets**
 - Scroller (plus native scrolling hookups)
