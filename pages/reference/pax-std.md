# Pax Standard Library (`pax-std`)

`pax-std` includes most of Pax's built-in practical functionality.

It also offers a canonical example of creating reusable [components](../key-concepts/components.mdx) and [primitives](../key-concepts/primitives.mdx), exporting them through Rust's module system and using Cargo to load them into other Rust + Pax projects.

See the source code for a directory of pax-std: [https://github.com/paxengine/pax/tree/master/pax-std/src](https://github.com/paxengine/pax/tree/master/pax-std/src)
