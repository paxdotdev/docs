# Examples

We have some examples of pax in the our mono-repo under [examples/src](https://github.com/paxengine/pax/tree/master/examples/src). 

You can run them by going to the root of the repository and running 

```bash
cargo run --example EXAMPLE_NAME
```

Here is one of the examples (`space-game`). How high of a score can you get?
