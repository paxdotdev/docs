```rust
#[pax(
    <Rectangle @click=self.handle_click>
)]
pub struct HelloEvents {}
impl HelloEvents {
    pub fn handle_click(&mut self, _ctx: &NodeContext, args: Event<Click>) {

    }
}
```

In the above example, `on_click=self.handle_click` binds a the `handle_click` method defined in the host codebase to the built-in `click` event which Pax fires when a user clicks the mouse on this element.

Events fire as "interrupts" and are allowed to execute arbitrary, side-effectful, imperative logic — anything you can write or use in Rust.

It is inside event handlers that you will normally [change property values](./start-key-concepts-properties-settings.md#settings-at-runtime), using `.set` or `.ease_to`.

Pax includes a number of built-in user interaction events like `@click` and `@tap`.  These can all be bound and handled in the same manner.

There are two types of events in Pax:

## Lifecycle Events

Lifecycle events run at the various points of the lifecycle a component. 

Lifecycle events are registered in a settings block on a Pax Template:

```rust
#[pax(
    <Rectangle>
    
    @settings {
        @tick: handle_tick
    }
)]
pub struct HelloEvents {}
impl HelloEvents {
    pub fn handle_tick(&mut self, _ctx: &NodeContext) {

    }
}

```

Pax exposes three lifecycle events:

### Tick

Tick is a fundamental unit of pax-engine, similar to a clock cycle. If you want a computation to happen every frame, you likely want to put it in the tick method. 

### Mount

Mount runs whenever a component is placed in the scene. It should run once per component. 

### Pre-render

Pre-render runs every frame like tick but right before the component is rendered. 


## Input Events

Input events run when user's interact with the Pax UI.

Here's an example of adding click handler to the HelloEvents component: 

```rust
#[pax(
    <Rectangle @click=self.handle_click>
)]
pub struct HelloEvents {}
impl HelloEvents {
    pub fn handle_click(&mut self, _ctx: &NodeContext, args: Event<Click>) {

    }
}
```

You can attach an input event handler to any node in a template with an inline binding (`@name_of_event=name_of_function`) on the tag. The associated function is implemented in the Component's impl block as seen above. The arguments for all events can be found [here](https://github.com/paxengine/pax/blob/51ed9d6be8e497f6e6eb54e93c9f0c983b283924/pax-runtime-api/src/lib.rs#L86). 

Pax supports the following input events:
- Scroll (@scroll)
- Clap (@clap)
- TouchStart (@touch_start)
- TouchMove (@touch_move)
- TouchEnd (@touch_end)
- KeyDown (@key_down)
- KeyUp (@key_up)
- KeyPress (@key_press)
- CheckboxChange (@checkbox_change)
- ButtonClick (@button_click)
- TextboxChange (@textbox_change)
- TextInput (@text_input)
- TextboxInput (@textbox_input)
- Click (@click)
- MouseDown (@mouse_down)
- MouseUp (@mouse_up)
- MouseMove (@mouse_move)
- MouseOver (@mouse_over)
- MouseOut (@mouse_out)
- DoubleClick (@double_click)
- ContextMenu (@context_menu)
- Wheel (@wheel)
