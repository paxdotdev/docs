# Primitives

Primitives are a special case of `component` — with direct access to the engine, runtime, and rendering context.  Primitives are authored in pure Rust, without any Pax language sugar: templates, expressions, or settings.

Most of Pax's included primitives are housed in the standard library, including: `<Group />`, `<Rectangle />`, `<Frame />`, and `<Image />`.  

The built-in constructs for control flow, like `if` (`Conditional`) and `for` (`Repeat`) are implemented as primitives, too, with special handling by the engine.


## Using & Authoring Primitives

**Using** primitives is easy.  Any place you can use a component in a template, you can use a `primitive` instance in exactly the same way.  For example, `<Stacker />` is a component, but `<Rectangle />` is a primitive.  They are consumed the same way.

**Authoring** primitives is more advanced.  More thorough documentation could be written, but for now refer to `pax-std/pax-std-primitives/src/*` and `pax-std/src/lib.rs`.  Primitives are authored in an engine-adjacent context, where certain imports are disallowed to avoid circular dependencies.  

This complexity is due to Pax's [compilation model](/reference-compilation-model), where the userland logic is ultimately a _dependency of_ the engine, instead of the other way around.  This is normally papered over when writing normal components and applications — the compiler handles this dependency inversion.

One more way to think of the above, through the [NES cartridge model](): Primitives are authored in the context of the _console_ rather than the context of _cartridges_.

Primitives are exposed cartridge-side (e.g. for importing and using `<Group />`) through the `pax_primitive` macro — you can find examples of this in `pax-std/src/lib.rs`.
