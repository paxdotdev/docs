# Linux (Debian / Ubuntu) workstation

## 1. Install toolchains

- Get rust (if already installed, ensure rustc version 1.73.0 or higher):

  ```bash copy
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

- Download required packages:

  ```bash copy
  apt update && apt install pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libssl-dev libpango1.0-dev
  ```

- Web build requires wasm-pack: 

  ```bash copy
  cargo install wasm-pack
  ```

## 2. Install pax-cli

  ```bash copy
  cargo install pax-cli
  ```

  NOTE: `cargo install pax-cli` and first run of `pax-cli run` might take some time.  Subsequent builds are faster.

## 3. Run

You can either **run the examples in the Pax repo** (recommended while the project is in [Alpha](https://github.com/paxengine/pax?tab=readme-ov-file#status), or you can **create a project from scratch.**

### Running examples in the Pax repo (recommended)
[Follow the instructions in the GitHub README](https://github.com/paxengine/pax?tab=readme-ov-file#examples)

### Creating a project from scratch

- Create a new project:

  ```bash copy
  pax-cli new my-first-project
  ```

- Run: 

  ```bash copy
  cd my-first-project && pax-cli run --target=web
  ```
