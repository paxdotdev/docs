## Planned support

In addition to native macOS builds, we intend to support native Windows and various Linux builds as well.

The macOS target is our proof of concept for integration with SwiftUI and macOS, but it is not currently a prioritized target for our core team.
Our leading edge of development is the web target.

## Build Pax applications as native macOS apps

- Building macOS apps requires running a Mac with macOS.  This is a constraint enforced technically and legally by Apple.
- Install xcode `>=15.0` and Xcode command line utils: `xcode-select --install`
- Make sure to accept Xcode's license agreement (prompted during Xcode startup for the first time)
- SDK Version `macosx13.3`, Xcode version `>=15.0`
- Current Minimum Deployment `13.0`
- Install all necessary build architectures for Rust, so that binaries can be built for both Intel and Apple Silicon macs
  ```shell copy
  rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
  ```
