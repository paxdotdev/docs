# VSCode and IntelliJ Plugins

We strongly recommend installing a plugin to make Pax easier to learn and write.

So far, two code editor plugins are available for Pax --

<br />
<br />

# VSCode
VSCode is our best supported editor, via Pax's implementation of the language server protocol. (see LSP [source code](https://github.com/paxproject/pax/tree/master/pax-language-server) and plugin [source code](https://github.com/paxproject/vscode-extension))

In addition to syntax highlighting, the VSCode plugin includes rich LSP features like go-to-definition and contextual autocomplete.

# IntelliJ

We've also built a plugin for IntelliJ, which supports syntax highlighting only.  Maintaining the IntelliJ plugin (as of Jan 2024) is not a top priority for us, but 
the [source code is available](https://github.com/paxproject/intellij-plugin) for anyone who would like to contribute.
